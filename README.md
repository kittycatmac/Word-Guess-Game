# Word Guess Game
This game uses Javascript to randomly choose a word from the array of Toy Story character list. Then the user can type letters to try and fill in the word. Once a letter is typed it either gets added to the word or if not in the word sent to the bone yard so the user can see the letters that are not in the word. The user can also see how many guesses are remaining. Once the user guesses the word then a window pops up to inform of the win! If the user doesn't gues the word then a window pops up to infrom of the lose. I added music to a player on the right side below the Mr. Potatoe gif.

# To Get Started
Press any letter key to start the guessing of the word. Watch the amount of guesses left and the bone yard to determine the word and all the words are characters from Toy Story. Press the play button to have music. To start a new game and word to guess click the refresh button on the browser.

Built with: HTML, CSS and Javascript

# Deployment
This is a very simple hangman game but if deployed on a larger scale more interactiveness with the photos, vidoes or songs would be great.
